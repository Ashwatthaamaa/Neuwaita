## Installation
Clone the repository inside ~/.icons and select the theme in gnome-tweaks

## Requesting for new icons :
I understand you really want the icon but while making an icon request please mention actual name of the icon file that you want to request.

## How to find the **Actual name** of the icon ?â†´
* Icons are usually located inside /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/<Actual name of your app>
* For Flatpaks the location is /var/lib/flatpak/app/<Actual name of your app> the name of the folder is the name of your icon
* If you don't wanna find the icon in the files you can also look for the app in flathub go to the app you are requesting and scroll down to find installation instructions and there is a command you can copy as flatpak install flathub <Actual name of your app>
* I have not used snaps but you can find it via google and let me know so I can add the instructions here.
